# Predictive Maintenance System

## Introduction
The **Predictive Maintenance System** is a machine learning project designed to predict equipment failures before they occur. The system analyzes various sensor data to classify whether a machine is likely to fail due to different failure types. This predictive model enables companies to perform maintenance proactively, reduce downtime, and optimize operational efficiency. The project employs machine learning classification algorithms to predict equipment failure based on features like temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **models/**: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- **README.md**: Documentation file with project details.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python libraries to run the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

Install all dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains sensor and operational data of machinery. The dataset includes the following features:

- **UDI**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **Product ID**: ID of the product under operation.
- **Type**: Type of product (e.g., L, M, H).
- **Air Temperature [K]**: The air temperature around the machine.
- **Process Temperature [K]**: The temperature during the process.
- **Rotational Speed [rpm]**: Speed of rotation of the machine.
- **Torque [Nm]**: The torque applied to the machine.
- **Tool Wear [min]**: Duration of tool usage in minutes.
- **Target**: Binary variable indicating whether a machine has failed or not (1: Failed, 0: Not Failed).
- **Failure Type**: Type of failure such as `Heat Dissipation Failure`, `Power Failure`, `Overstrain Failure`, `Tool Wear Failure`, and `Random Failures`.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset are handled appropriately to ensure data consistency.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables such as `Product Type` and `Failure Type` are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical variables such as temperature, rotational speed, and torque are scaled to ensure consistency.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are created, such as interaction terms between variables to enhance the model’s predictive power.

## Model Training
The following machine learning classification algorithms are used to predict equipment failure:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable classification algorithm.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A model that splits the data into branches based on feature values, resulting in a tree-like structure of decision rules.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: A gradient boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially to minimize classification errors.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positives (sensitivity).
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: A performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings, showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd predictive-maintenance
    ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open `notebooks/Predictive_Maintenance.ipynb` to view the step-by-step implementation or use the Python scripts in the `src/` directory for standalone predictions.

4. **Predict Machine Failure**:
    Use the `src/predict.py` script to input operational data and get a failure prediction:
    ```bash
    python src/predict.py --air_temp 300 --process_temp 305 --rot_speed 1500 --torque 50 --tool_wear 120
    ```

## Results
The models provide the following results on the test dataset:

- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy of 85%, F1-Score of 0.84.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Accuracy of 80%, F1-Score of 0.78.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Accuracy of 90%, F1-Score of 0.88.
- **SVM**: Accuracy of 88%, F1-Score of 0.86.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Accuracy of 92%, F1-Score of 0.90.

The Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and F1-Score.

## Future Enhancements
- **Data Augmentation**: Use synthetic data generation techniques to expand the dataset and improve model robustness.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Integrate the model into a real-time predictive maintenance system that continuously monitors machine sensor data.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques to further enhance model performance.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web service or API for seamless integration with industrial IoT platforms.
